# TWCrossLinks
TWCrossLinks is the core plugin of [Drift](https://akhater.github.io/drift) that I have repacked as a separate plugin since I realize that not a lot would prefer to add a plugin to their existing installation instead of install the whole package.

# Features:
* Adds a footer in the bottom of every Tiddler showing the keywords of that tiddler (if present)
* Adds a footer in the bottom of every Tiddler showing all different types of inbound links to that tiddler (if present)
** Backlinks
** Tags
** Keywords
** Freelinks
* Fotters will not show unless existing 
* External Reference tracking
* Transclude External websites in a pop-up

# Change log
